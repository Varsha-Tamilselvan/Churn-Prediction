#**Gym Members Churn Prediction using Decision Tree**</div>

##Overview:
Predicting gym member churn using a Decision Tree classifier to help gyms identify members at risk of leaving and improve retention strategies.

##Dataset:
**[Kaggle: Churn Prediction Gym Members Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassaan2580/churn-prediction-gym-members-dataset)**


##Steps

###Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values by analyzing distributions.

Converted data types appropriately (categorical, datetime).

###Model Training

Split data into training and test sets.

Fitted a Decision Tree Classifier to predict churn.

###Model Evaluation

Evaluated predictions using confusion matrix and classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).

###Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

##Conclusion:
The Decision Tree model effectively predicts churn, providing actionable insights for member retention.
